Planned Enhancements
====================

- Improved sample selection when one of the subsampling options (``n`` or ``frac``) is activated: sampling will be performed with consideration of the output distribution, whether for classification or regression
- Automatic smoothing of outputed trends of ``apyxl.TimeSeriesNormalizer`` ?
- Numerical experiments will be conducted to compare the capabilities of ``apyxl`` with traditional econometric techniques
- In addition, a ``apyxl.DiffInDiff`` class will be developed
- Model saving
