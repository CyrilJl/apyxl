Planned Enhancements
====================

- Improved sample selection when one of the subsampling options (``n`` or ``frac``) is activated: sampling will consider the output distribution, whether for classification or regression.
- Automatic smoothing of output trends in ``apyxl.TimeSeriesNormalizer``.
- Numerical experiments will be conducted to compare the capabilities of ``apyxl`` with traditional econometric techniques.
- Development of an ``apyxl.DiffInDiff`` class.
- Model saving functionality.
- Early stopping during the fitting process.
